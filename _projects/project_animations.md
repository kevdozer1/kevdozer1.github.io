This is my favorite animation I have made so far. This was the first time I was able to really visualize some abstract thought I had and make it a reality. The animation was inspired by a picture I had seen of the Lincoln Park Conservatory in Chicago.

This is the animation that I think impresses people the most. I made this one to try out a variety of lighting techniques. It looks pretty realistic, but you would be surprised how easy some semblance of realism is to create. My favorite part is the dress.

My final project from the famous Blender donut tutorial. I really like the way the plate turned out.

Tried to do something with some semblance of color theory. Looks cool anyways.

Such a weird animation, but it makes me laugh.
