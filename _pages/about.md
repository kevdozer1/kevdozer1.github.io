Hello. Welcome to my web page. This page is for me to post my thoughts to the smallest audience possible. Thank you for visiting it.

Goals for the page:

Blog - Any rant and rave that I would like to share

Projects - Here I will post any bigger technical/creative things I have done since making this page.

Repositories - Links to GitHub repositories that should accompany any of the projects listed on this website

About me - Never-before-seen glimpse into the twisted mind of Kevin Hopkins

That's it. Hope you have a nice day
