Grown and nurtured in a lab until age 12, Kevin Hopkins is a Harvard social experiment. The name 'Kevin Hopkins' is a slang term adopted from Cajun riverboat slang; my real name is a sequence of numbers that redirects to a randomly selected Fortune 500 webpage when clicked. 

I like computer graphics, 3D animation, movies, comedy, and whatever makes me sound cool in conversation. I graduated from UW-Madison in the spring of 2022 and am currently doing my master's degree at USC in computer science. My favorite comedian is Norm Macdonald. My favorite movie is Ratatouille. I probably have about 10 friends which I feel like is a lot if you really think about it. I like big, old, slow dogs. My favorite animal is either a gorilla or an axolotl. I am an optimist and a generalist at heart.
